# KeyClubInterviewWebsite
## Website for key club Web Master interview to showcase my past projects

This is my first project built alone with react. I originally planned on using remix (Next.js competitor which I think will take over by the end of this year). 
But since this website is only one page and very simple, I have decided not to use remix because that is meant for larger websites/apps that have multiple pages. 
I do plan on using remix in the near future. But for now, I will stick with react. I have finished the figma design for the website, and will continue building it. 
I need it completed by Friday, Febuary 25th. Because that is when my interview will be. I am very excited to show off my past projects to them. 

It is currently Wedendsday the 23rd, so I have 2 more days to finish this website. Which might be a little challenging since it is my first official project in react. 
But I believe I can get it done. Worst case scenario, I just rebuild it in simple HTML CSS and JavaScript. Which wouldn't be hard but I won't have nearly as much time 
for styling. And I would like to show off my CSS skills.
